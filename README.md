# ProductiveStudying
 ## Use better studying practices to understand the concepts while also incentivising studying

 - This is an applet that will basically work like a timer, but it will alternatively go off every 25 minutes and then 5 minutes, telling you whether you need to study or take a break.
 - This way you are always productive and you study for 2.5 hours in 3 hours and 5 hours in 6 hours instead of spending your time on a downward curve of productivity.
 - If you do the math, you will find that You get 83% of your total time spent at approximately 100% productivity, which is far superior to a exponentially losing productivity and retaining nothing
 - This is a much more efficient studying method than going until you burn out.
 
 #### There is an alarm sound that goes off every time one setting ends.
 #### The timer is based on unix epoch time.
> This entire project has just been a learning opportunity for me, which is why I have added a test button for seeing whether the way that I have programmed 404.html is functional or not

> Microsoft recently added a similar functionality to this, but it's natively in Windows through focus modes... I was here first lol
