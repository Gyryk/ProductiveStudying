# ProductiveStudying
 Use better studying practices to understand the concepts while also incentivising studying

 this is an applet that will basically work like a timer 
 but it will alternatively go off every 25 minutes and then 5 minutes
 and it will tell you whether you need to study or take a break
 this will keep going on till you close the website
 this way you are always productive and you study 2 and a half hours in 3 hours and 5 hours in 6 hours
 instead of spending your time on a downward curve of productivity you get 83% of total time spent at 100% productivity
 this is a much more efficient studying method
 there is an alarm sound that goes off every time one setting ends
 this was the highest compatibility option as anything that has a web browser can run this website
 the timer is based on unix epoch time with milliseconds
 it is currently being hosted on github pages and should be easily accessible everywhere with a secure connection
