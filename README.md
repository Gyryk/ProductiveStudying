# ProductiveStudying
 Use better studying practices to understand the concepts while also incentivising studying

 This is an applet that will basically work like a timer, but it will alternatively go off every 25 minutes and then 5 minutes, telling you whether you need to study or take a break. <br>
 This way you are always productive and you study for 2.5 hours in 3 hours and 5 hours in 6 hours instead of spending your time on a downward curve of productivity. <br>
 You get 83% of total time spent at 100% productivity. <br>
 This is a much more efficient studying method than going until you burn out. <br>
 
 #### There is an alarm sound that goes off every time one setting ends.
 #### The timer is based on unix epoch time.

> Microsoft recently added a similar functionality to Windows natively through focus modes... Bruh moment
