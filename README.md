# ProductiveStudying
 Use better studying practices to understand the concepts while also incentivising studying

 This is an applet that will basically work like a timer, but it will alternatively go off every 25 minutes and then 5 minutes, telling you whether you need to study or  take a break.
 This way you are always productive and you study for 2.5 hours in 3 hours and 5 hours in 6 hours instead of spending your time on a downward curve of productivity. 
 You get 83% of total time spent at 100% productivity.
 This is a much more efficient studying method than going until you burn out.
 There is an alarm sound that goes off every time one setting ends.
 
 The timer is based on unix epoch time.
